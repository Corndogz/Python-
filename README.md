A Python Program to Calculate Compound Interest

Python Program to Calculate Compound Interest
A = P(1 + R/100)T
Where,
A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.
P is the principal amount
R is the rate and
T is the time span
The user input is taken using input() function which takes input as a string. But as we are doing the calculation part, we need the input to be a float. So, we did the type-conversion using float() function.
The input from the user is taken as p for the principal amount, t for the time in years and r for the interest rate. The function is defined with def keyword that takes three arguments,  principal, rate and time. The formula is applied and result is returned to the calling function and the output is displayed using print() function.
